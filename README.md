**You should read "/(version of assets pack)/password.txt" if the archive ask for password. Don't worry if you don't see the file. That's because the archive has no password.
Due to anti-copying content by bots and for guarante integrity, i have to set the password.
If the password in second dialog isn't matching the password.txt, THAT IS A MALWARE!!**

**The password in first dialog always is "Henry133DevAssets".**
